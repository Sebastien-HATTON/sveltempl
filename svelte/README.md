# The svelte side of SvelTempl

> The following commands are for reference only. The Make tasks will call these internally, so you don't need to call them explicitly during dev or build. You'll only need to install dependencies with `npm install`.


Dev mode:
```
npm run dev
```

Build:
```
npm run build
```

Only build for Go SSR:
```
npm run build:ssr-go
```
